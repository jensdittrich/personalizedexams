# personalizedexams

This is a small framework explaining how to run python directly from LaTex. We use this to generate personalized exams. See this presentation.

## General compilation process:

## Create problem and solution separately:

## Create many variants of the same exam:

## compile

```console
foo@bar:~$ MATRICULATIONID=132 SEED=12 pdflatex --enable-pipes --shell-escape exam.tex
```
Compiles the pdf using SEED as the seed for the pseudo-random engine: make sure to use a SEED that is a function of the matriculationid, like that the generation process is determinsitic for every student.

## contributors

I would like to thank my Ph.D students Immanuel Haffner, Marcel Maltry, Christian Sch√∂n, and Joris Nix for contributing to this project (beyond this dummy example in this repository).
